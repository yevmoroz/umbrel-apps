tagline: Expose your services easily and securely
description: >-
  Expose web services on your network · Free SSL with Let's Encrypt · Designed with security in mind · Perfect for home networks

  Expose your private network Web services and get connected anywhere.

  Based on Tabler, the interface is a pleasure to use. Configuring a server has never been so fun.

  Built in Let’s Encrypt support allows you to secure your Web services at no cost to you. The certificates even renew themselves!

  Built as a Docker Image, Nginx Proxy Manager only requires a database.

  Configure other users to either view or manage their own hosts. Full access permissions are available.
